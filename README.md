## react
1. just a view layer, it is a view linker, it is the tree component
2. virtual DOM (document object model)
3. uses flux (pattern, uni-directional data flow, MVC but better)
uni-directional means that:
   |<--------------------------
actions->                     |
actions->dispatcher->store->view
actions->-----------(unidirectional)
